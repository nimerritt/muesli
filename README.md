Json-schema is full of sugar. Let's restrict it to the essentials and
have a great day.

This subset is designed specifically to be easily converted to

## Todo:
- [ ] Validate test cases against muesli schema
- [ ] Setup test suite against TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Implement Muesli-schema to TypeScript interface

# Muesli Swagger Server
