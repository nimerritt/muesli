# Muesli-Schema - JSON-Schema with less sugar

Muesli-schema is a subset of JSON-schema designed specifically to be
easily converted to Typescript and other static-type systems. 

The primary use-case is for creating statically-typed servers and clients
from a Swagger specification.

The TypeScript and JSON-schema definitions are contained in
[muesli-schema](https://github.com/nimerritt/muesli/tree/master/muesli-schema).

Tooling to convert Muesli-Schema to TypeScript interfaces are defined in 
[muesli-tools](https://github.com/nimerritt/muesli/tree/master/muesli-tools).
